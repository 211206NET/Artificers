Day2 Topics:

Jargon:
Blockers: things are blocking progress

Repository: Version control of source code. Single version of project saved (like github) .git folder
meta info about repository stored here

Source Code: Application you're building 
Team Name: Manticore, Artificers

Branch: repo and work taken from it

Course:
Source Control Managment (VCS, CVCS, DVCS)
VCS: Version Control System: backs up work, allows collab
	>Repository tracks changes

CVCS: CVCS is dependent on the access to the server.

DVCS: (git) every user has a local copy of the repository in addition 
to the central repo on the server side.  DVCS provides the benefits to 
work offline. Everything except push and pull the code can be done without 
an internet connection

GIT DVCS: Most popular, best.
GITHUB: Cloud Host of GIT repositories

in GIT Make repository public, returns repo code
first be in dir where repo is

git init create repository
git init <respository name>
git remote add <short name> <url to remote repo> add itto local : to add
git clone <url to repo>  : get remote repo to a local repo you don't have
git clone /path/to/repository : clone local repo to another local

gitignore: don't commit sensitive data
	touch .gitignore
	code .gitignore
	add file.ext to ignore list

git add .   : to add files to staging area
git add hw.txt  : or add one file to staging
git status : shows changes/unchanged so far
git pull : getchanges from remote repo to local you alreadygit Pull have
git commit -m "important message about push" to local
git push --set-upstream origin main    : Final confirm : sends all commits 
git push --set-upstream origin test    : Final confirm for branch test
git log : read out of commit

git branch : list all the branches present in the repo
git branch --help
git branch -d nameofbranch
git branch â€“d <branch-name> : delete
git checkout branchname : go to rbanch
git branch <new-branch-name>
git checkout -b <branch-name>
git remote -v : shows all remote repos
git remote add origin <host-or-remoteURL>  : To connect the local repository to a remote server
git remote rm <name-of-the-repository> : Will delete a connection to a specified remote repo

git merge <branch name>
git pull origin main

in git pull request, better way to merge to main
