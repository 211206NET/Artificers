Hello, 

My name is Matthew Wiese. I just joined Revature to switch careers to become a 
software engineer. I was doing code at my job with VBA every day anyway, but not getting 
paid anything for extra it, but I enjoyed doing it. With no real upward mobility at my 
last job, I decided for a more ambitious approach.

I changed this on 12/8
