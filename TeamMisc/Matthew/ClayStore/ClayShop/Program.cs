// - Workflow of Viewing StoreFront Inventory
// 1. I want to hide this functionality unless they're logged in
//     - Check if they're logged in or not
//     - Have currentCustomer set to a default, that will be null before 
        //they log in (So once they 'login', the current customer is not 
        //null, and has current customer info)
//     - And then once I know that it's not null, then I'll display this menu

// 2. Prompt the user to log in (if they haven't)
//     - I need to go back to the log in menu (of a sort)
//     - And then give them log in screen again

// 3. Prompt them to select which storefront to browse
//     - First, I need to grab all storefronts
//     - Iterate through the stores and display them
//     - Once they select the storefront, save it somewhere so I can query the inventory 
        //of the store

// 4. Once they select a storefront, query the inventory of the storefront
//     a. Find all inventory that belongs to the storefront
//     b. Then iterate through that list and display the inventory accordingly

// 5. Display the storefront inventory with (its quantity, maybe?)
